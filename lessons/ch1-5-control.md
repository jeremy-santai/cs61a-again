# 1.5 Control

The expressive power of the functions that we can define at this point is very limited, because we have not introduced a way to make comparisons and to perform different operations depending on the result of a comparison. _Control statements_ will give us this ability. They are statements that control the flow of a program's execution based on the results of logical comparisons.

Statements differ fundamentally from the expressions that we have studied so far. They have no value. Instead of computing something, executing a control statement determines what the interpreter should do next.

## 1.5.1 Statements

So far, we have primarily considered how to evaluate expressions. However, we have seen three kinds of statements already: assignment, def, and return statements. These lines of Python code are not themselves expressions, although they all contain expressions as components.

Rather than being evaluated, statements are _executed_. Each statement describes some change to the interpreter state, and executing a statement applies that change.

Consider, for instance:

```python
>>> def square(x):
        mul(x, x)  # Watch out! This call doesn't return a value.
```

This example is valid Python, but probably not what was intended. The body of the function consists of an expression. An expression by itself is a valid statement, but the effect of the statement is that the mul function is called, and the result is discarded. If you want to do something with the result of an expression, you need to say so:

```python
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
```

Sometimes it does make sense to have a function whose body is an expression, when a non-pure function like print is called:

```python
>>> def print_square(x):
        print(square(x))
```

## 1.5.2 Compound Statements

In general, Python code is a sequence of statements. A simple statement is a single line that doesn't end in a colon. A compound statement is so called because it is composed of other statements (simple and compound). Compound statements typically span multiple lines and start with a one-line header ending in a colon, which identifies the type of statement. Together, a header and an indented suite of statements is called a clause:

```
<header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
<separating header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
```

We can understand the statements we have already introduced in these terms:

- Expressions, return statements, and assignment statements are simple statements.
- A def statement is a compound statement. The suite that follows the def header defines the function body.

Specialized evaluation rules for each kind of header dictate when and if the statements in its suite are executed. We say that the header controls its suite.

**Practical Guidance.** When indenting a suite, all lines must be indented the same amount and in the same way (use spaces, not tabs). Any variation in indentation will cause an error.

## 1.5.3 Defining Functions II: Local Assignment

Whenever a user-defined function is applied, the sequence of clauses in the suite of its definition is executed in a local environment — an environment starting with a local frame created by calling that function. A return statement redirects control: the process of function application terminates whenever the first return statement is executed, and the value of the return expression is the returned value of the function being applied.

Assignment statements can appear within a function body. For instance, this function returns the absolute difference between two quantities as a percentage of the first, using a two-step calculation:

```python
def percent_difference(x, y):
    difference = abs(x-y)
    return 100 * difference / x

result = percent_difference(40, 50)
```

The effect of an assignment statement is to bind a name to a value in the _first_ frame of the current environment. As a consequence, assignment statements within a function body cannot affect the global frame. The fact that functions can only manipulate their local environment is critical to creating _modular_ programs, in which pure functions interact only via the values they take and return.

## 1.5.4 Conditional Statements

Python has a built-in function for computing absolute values:

```python
>>> abs(-2)
2
```

We can express our own implementation with a conditional statement:

```python
def absolute_value(x):
    """Compute abs(x)."""
    if x > 0:
        return x
    elif x == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return -x

result = absolute_value(-2)
```

A conditional statement in Python consists of a series of headers and suites: a required if clause, an optional sequence of elif clauses, and finally an optional else clause:

```
if <expression>:
    <suite>
elif <expression>:
    <suite>
else:
    <suite>
```

When executing a conditional statement, each clause is considered in order:

1. Evaluate the header's expression.
2. If it is a true value, execute the suite. Then, skip over all subsequent clauses in the conditional statement.

**Boolean contexts.** Python includes several false values, including 0, None, and the boolean value False. All other numbers are true values.

**Boolean values.** Python has two boolean values, called True and False. The built-in comparison operations, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, return these values:

```python
>>> 4 < 2
False
>>> 5 >= 5
True
```

**Boolean operators.** Three basic logical operators are also built into Python:

```python
>>> True and False
False
>>> True or False
True
>>> not False
True
```

Logical expressions support _short-circuiting_:

- `<left> and <right>`: evaluate left; if false, return it; otherwise return right
- `<left> or <right>`: evaluate left; if true, return it; otherwise return right
- `not <exp>`: True if exp is false, False otherwise

## 1.5.5 Iteration

Consider the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in which each number is the sum of the preceding two:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

We can use a while statement to enumerate n Fibonacci numbers:

```python
def fib(n):
    """Compute the nth Fibonacci number, for n >= 2."""
    pred, curr = 0, 1  # Fibonacci numbers 1 and 2
    k = 2  # Which Fib number is curr?
    while k < n:
        pred, curr = curr, pred + curr
        k = k + 1
    return curr

result = fib(8)
```

Remember that commas separate multiple names and values in an assignment statement. The line `pred, curr = curr, pred + curr` has the effect of rebinding the name pred to the value of curr, and simultaneously rebinding curr to the value of pred + curr. All of the expressions to the right of = are evaluated before any rebinding takes place.

A while clause contains a header expression followed by a suite:

```
while <expression>:
    <suite>
```

To execute a while clause:

1. Evaluate the header's expression.
2. If it is a true value, execute the suite, then return to step 1.

A while statement that does not terminate is called an infinite loop. Press `<Control>-C` to force Python to stop looping.

## 1.5.6 Testing

_Testing_ a function is the act of verifying that the function's behavior matches expectations.

A _test_ is a mechanism for systematically performing this verification. Tests typically take the form of another function that contains one or more sample calls to the function being tested.

**Assertions.** Programmers use assert statements to verify expectations:

```python
>>> assert fib(8) == 13, 'The 8th Fibonacci number should be 13'
```

When the expression being asserted evaluates to a true value, executing an assert statement has no effect. When it is a false value, assert causes an error that halts execution.

A test function for fib should test several arguments, including extreme values of n:

```python
>>> def fib_test():
        assert fib(2) == 1, 'The 2nd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(3) == 1, 'The 3rd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(50) == 7778742049, 'Error at the 50th Fibonacci number'
```

**Doctests.** Python provides a convenient method for placing simple tests directly in the docstring of a function:

```python
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

        >>> sum_naturals(10)
        55
        >>> sum_naturals(100)
        5050
        """
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
```

Then, the interaction can be verified via the doctest module:

```python
>>> from doctest import testmod
>>> testmod()
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
```

When writing Python in files, all doctests in a file can be run by starting Python with the doctest command line option:

```
python3 -m doctest <python_source_file>
```

The key to effective testing is to write (and run) tests immediately after implementing new functions. A test that applies a single function is called a _unit test_. Exhaustive unit testing is a hallmark of good program design.
